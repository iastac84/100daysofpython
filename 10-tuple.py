# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable / immutable
# Tuples are written with round brackets.

# There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

# List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
# Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

tuple1 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
tuple2 = (1, 5, 7, 9, 3)
tuple3 = (True, False, False)
tuple4 = ("abc", 34, True, 40, "male")

print(tuple1)
print(tuple2)
print(tuple3)
print(tuple4)

print(type(tuple1))

# Tuple can be overwritten 
tuple1 = ("chips", "burger", "carrot")
print(tuple1)
